While they do survive in cooler climates, they show a preference for a temperature similar to that of their homeworld. The protuberance between an Arcona's eyes is an incredibly sensitive infrared sensory organ, able to detect minute changes in the heat signatures of other beings. The Arcona smell via their tongues, which is why they often expose this slender appendage to the air in a flicking gesture that some other species might find annoying or even insulting. Working in concert, these senses are exact enough to discern moodsand emotions in other species.","brawn":1,"agility":2,"intellect":2,"cunning":2,"willpower":3,"presence":2,"startXP":100,"wounds":10,"strain":10,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in Vigilance.","specialAbilities":"May remove 1 Setback imposed due to arid or hot environmental conditions.
