Their skin is covered in scales that typically range in color from tan to blue or purple. Their elongated skulls house two large eyes, a broad nose, and a large, toogh-filled mouth. The curvature of their mouth suggests a perpetual smile to many non-Aleena. Mature Aleena average about eighty centimeters in height. Unlike many reptilian species, Aleen are warm-blooded. They maintain their body temperature in part through a particularly rapid digestive system, believed to be a by-product of the competitive nature of their homeworld. The ability to rapidly convert food into energy is tightly linked to the species' charateristic quickness. Aleen are omnivores who typically prefer very spicy cuisine, but there is no clear physiological basis for this preference. Visitors to their homes and world are often surprised by the food's intensity.","brawn":1,"agility":3,"intellect":2,"cunning":2,"willpower":2,"presence":2,"startXP":95,"wounds":8,"strain":10,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in Coordination and 1 rank in the Durable talent.","specialAbilities":"Smaller than average and count as silhouette 0."}}}}
