Unfortunately, most of what they are asked to do involves patching up the wounds of the worst kind of beings. Most Doctors trade their healing talents for a chance to see more of the galaxy than their time in medical school ever allowed. Their overall motives can be as varied as those of any being, yet they tend to share a common instinct to heal where there is harm. While many will simply take up residence with whatever lord, corporation, or boss will hire them, other Doctors will find a way to get out into the larger galaxy, both to bring help to those in need and to experience life in some fashion.","careerSkills":["Cool","Knowledge (Education)","Medicine","Resilience"],"talents":[{"name":"Surgeon","description":"When making a Medicine check to help a character heal wounds, the target heals 1 additional wound per rank of Surgeon.","column":1,"row":1,"passive":true,"connections":[false,false,false,true]},{"name":"Bacta Specialist","description":"Patients regain 1 additional wound per rank of Bacta Specialist when they recover wounds from bacta tanks or long term care.","column":2,"row":1,"passive":true,"connections":[false,false,false,false]},{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 Strain Threshold","column":3,"row":1,"passive":true,"connections":[false,false,false,true]},{"name":"Resolve","description":"When a character involuntarily suffers strain, he suffers 1 less strain per rank of Resolve, to a minimum of 1.","column":4,"row":1,"passive":true,"connections":[false,false,false,false]},{"name":"Stim Application","description":"Take the Stim Application Action: make an Average Medicine check.
