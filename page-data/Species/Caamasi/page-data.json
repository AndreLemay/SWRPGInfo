They are more notable for other aspects of their appearance, including a dense coat of gray or brown fur. Their hands are unusually thin, with only three fingers, but Caamasi can grip a blaster or datapad firmly. Perhaps the most unusual aspect of their appearance is a beak-like snout, lined with sharp teeth, creating a far more fearsome impression than the species' pacifist culture would indicate. Caamasi are also notable for their highly developed sense of smell, and for the odor they emit. Other species have likened in to the sharp, woody scent of Corellian whiskey. The Caamasi do not seem to notice the smell despite their finely tuned noses, perhaps due to over-familiarity.","brawn":2,"agility":2,"intellect":2,"cunning":1,"willpower":3,"presence":2,"startXP":100,"wounds":10,"strain":11,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in either Charm or Discipline.","specialAbilities":"Once per session,can form a permanent memory, called a memnis, that encompasses one scene or encounter.
