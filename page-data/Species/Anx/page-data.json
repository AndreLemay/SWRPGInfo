However, the species can often reach four meters in height, despite these restrictions. Their great height allowed the Anx to easily harvest the bounty of their homeworld's chiliox trees when they emerged from their subterranean habitat. Because the Anx evolved within the cave systems of their homeworld, their voices have a natural low-frequency echo that, while useful for communicating across vast distances underground, tends to make other species deeply uncomfortable. The Anx in turn are frequently discomfited by how other species have learned to read the color changes of the large crest atop their head as an indicator of their mood, a quirk of their communal lives in their native herd-based social structure.","brawn":3,"agility":1,"intellect":2,"cunning":2,"willpower":2,"presence":2,"startXP":85,"wounds":13,"strain":10,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in the Kill with Kindness talent and 1 rank of the Lethal Blows talent.","specialAbilities":"If head-crest is not covered, upgrade difficulty of Deception checks once."}}}}
