All three possess bulky bodies, with the Aquala's being further distended with a healthy layer of insulating fat. However, most Aquala spend their entire lives on Ando, seldom if ever leaving their homeworld. Both the Ualaq and the Quara are far more likely to be seen off-world, since their hands are better suited to using the technology of other species. The Quara have a reputation for being thugs and criminals, while most of the Ualaq have moved offworld to avoid persecution by the Aquala. The facial features of all three Aqualish sub-species combine elements of arachnid and aquatic mammal evolution. The placement of their tusks is often reminiscent to most sentients of the mandibles of a giant spider, aggravated by the thick fring of wiry brown or black hair and their black, pupil-less eyes. The skin's rubbery consistency and rough texture, meanwhile, recall the hides of a variety of aquatic mammals. Because of the close placement of their two sets of eyes, the Ualaq are the most arachnid in appearance.","brawn":3,"agility":2,"intellect":1,"cunning":2,"willpower":2,"presence":2,"startXP":90,"wounds":11,"strain":8,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in Brawl.
