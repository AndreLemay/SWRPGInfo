Assassins tend to prefer getting in quietly, taking out targets (either up close or sniping from afar), and leaving just as silently as they entered. Despite their different methods, Assassins still adhere to many of the same ethics and practices of other Bounty Hunters. They take their work very seriously, avoid all needless bloodshed, and honor their contracts to the letter. Some treat their methods with reverence, even assigning a certain mystique to it. Others simply see themselves as cold killers, and are just fine with it.",

However, with all of the dangers and wonders of \"a thousand thousand worlds,\" having someone around who actually knows something more than how to reload a heavy blaster could be exceedingly useful under any number of circumstances. This is especially true when a group is faced with something truly unknown, or needs to find something that simple tracking alone cannot locate. Even in the Outer Rim, there are those who have a keen respect for knowledge and leraning. Even criminal overlords find having some \"brains\" around helps them when they want to expand theri operations or exploit a new opportunity. Other Scholars, however, are far more interested in getting out into the galaxy, seeing for themselves the things they with to study, and digging around in ancient places for the lost konwledge they want to uncover. A Scholar in a group is very likely of the field researcher variety; seeking allies with physical capabilities who can defend him is a matter of somple expediency. It may be that he's signed on with some kind of operation that actually has no direct impact on his research, but the group is likely to travel to places he wishes to go, which suits his desires well.",

They have three fingers on each hand, which are as dextrous as those of other humanoids, allowing them to manipulate equipment designed for five-fingered individuals. Where Gand subspecies differ from one another is in their respiratory biology. Most Gands who travel the spacelanes do not seem to need to breathe at all. The digestion of food in their stomachs produces the ammonia necessary for their biochemistry. Wasteful byproducts and extraneous ammonia are expelled through their exoskeletons. These Gands often emanate an unpleasant methane musk. Other Gand subspecies possess actual lungs and cannot produce ammonia through digestion, instead requiring a special breathing apparatus.",

Adult females average about two meters tall, making them significantly taller than most humans, with slightly longer arms and legs. Males of hte species tend to be smaller and weaker than the females. Selonians have strong tails about a half meter long that they use to counterbalance themselves when walking upright. Though generally bipedal, Selonians can move comfortably on four limbs, and their retractable claws can be used for digging and burrowing, climbing, or defense. Most Selonians are sterile females, with only one fertile female per den, and relatively few males.",

All three possess bulky bodies, with the Aquala's being further distended with a healthy layer of insulating fat. However, most Aquala spend their entire lives on Ando, seldom if ever leaving their homeworld. Both the Ualaq and the Quara are far more likely to be seen off-world, since their hands are better suited to using the technology of other species. The Quara have a reputation for being thugs and criminals, while most of the Ualaq have moved offworld to avoid persecution by the Aquala. The facial features of all three Aqualish sub-species combine elements of arachnid and aquatic mammal evolution. The placement of their tusks is often reminiscent to most sentients of the mandibles of a giant spider, aggravated by the thick fring of wiry brown or black hair and their black, pupil-less eyes. The skin's rubbery consistency and rough texture, meanwhile, recall the hides of a variety of aquatic mammals. Because of the close placement of their two sets of eyes, the Ualaq are the most arachnid in appearance.",

In their default forms, their skin has a yellow to dark green. The pupils of their large eyes are slitted, with irises that range in color from yellow to deep blue. However, many galactic citizens who interact with Clawdites never actually see this form, or even know that they are dealing with a Clawdite. Some Clawdites create a single preferred guise that they use for their public dealings, never showing their true form. This has various advantages, from thowing potential enemies off guard when they reveal themselves to keeping suspicion that they might be an infiltrator to a minimum. After all, when people know there is a Clawdite around, they tend to be more cautious. On the other hand, some Clawdites use this to their advantage by openly displaying their true forms, to remind everyone of their unique ability - especially when that ability is an asset to the job at hand. Those Clawdites who do not rely upon their shapeshifting for professional reasons tend to remain in their default state aroudn others to ehlp reassure them that they are acting in good faith. These practices vary by individual and the expectations of the company that they currently keep.",

Their skin color ranges from red to green, and a pair of pointed horns dominate the maile Devaronian's head; commonly, females have dark, vestigial spots in the same location as the male's horns. Devaronians' mouths are filled with sharp pointed teeth, particularly effective at rending the meat that dominates their diets. Besides these identifying characteristics, Devaronians have a great many physiological similarities to humans - though few observers would confuse the two species. Devaronians have black, silver-based blood. This unusual trait is linked to their particularly thorough blood filtration and cleansing system. Members of the species possess two livers, which constantly cleanse the body of toxins and carcinogens. This grants them an exceptionally high resistance to poisons, also enabling them to consume foods that are toic to other species. Devaronian physiological quirks cause sulfur to be a particularly effetcive stimulant (unlike for most other oxygen-breating species, who find sulfur extremely unpleasant when inhaled). When a Devaronian breathes in sulfur, the substance rapidly enters the bloodstream. granting the Devaronian a burst of prodigious strength and speed. However, sulfur is one element that their livers cannot cleanse as effectively over the long term. Extended exposure to sulfur can have serious medical consequences for a Devaronian.",
