Their skin tones encompass a gamut of colors, from peachy tones to dark brown and black. Males average 1.8 meters tall, while females stand shorter and are generally not as stocky. They process oxygen for respiration and can digest a variety of animal and vegetable matter. Their biology is well-suited to many environments in the galaxy, which perhaps explains their dominance and ubiquity.","brawn":2,"agility":2,"intellect":2,"cunning":2,"willpower":2,"presence":2,"startXP":110,"wounds":10,"strain":10,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in 2 different non-career skills of your choice.","specialAbilities":""}}}}
