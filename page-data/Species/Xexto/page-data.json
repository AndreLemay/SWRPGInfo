Their small, round heads sit atop long necks, and reature large dark eyes and tiny mouths. Their skin is pale and can be shaded yellow, green, purple, or blue. The Xexto have two brains, with basic body functions under the purview of the head, and higher functions carried out in the chest. Their large, balck eyes are well suited to seeing in dark forests and caves, and Xexto often wear tinted goggles to protect their eyes when in areas of harsh, direct sunlight. Their reflexes are incredibly sharp, and they are mentally resilient in the face of trauma. Predators once dominated their homeworld, which helped test and develop Xexto quickness and resilience for millennia.","brawn":1,"agility":3,"intellect":2,"cunning":2,"willpower":1,"presence":2,"startXP":85,"wounds":9,"strain":9,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in the Confidence talent.","specialAbilities":"Gain an additional free maneuver per turn (still limited to 2 maneuvers per turn)."}}}}
