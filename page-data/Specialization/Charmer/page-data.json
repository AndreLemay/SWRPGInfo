When coaxing his way into a private club or restricted area, the Charmer knows how to compliment without sounding sycophantic. In rare cases when his debonair appearance and refined taste fails him, the Charmer knows how ot resort to negotiation and trickery to get his way, doing so with his own smooth brand of flair and style. The Charmer keeps a cool head in the hottest situations, which often serves as inspiration to others, and he has no qualms with taking a leadership role if it furthers his purposes. Whether or not he knows the right thing to say, the Charmer always knows how to say it.","careerSkills":["Charm","Cool","Leadership","Negotiation"],"talents":[{"name":"Smooth Talker","description":"When first acquired, choose 1 skill: Charm, Coercion, Deception, or Negotiation.
