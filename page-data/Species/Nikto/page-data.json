Bombarded for thousands of yeras by gamma radiation from a nearby magnetar star known as M'dweshuu, life on Kintan has had to adapt rapidly or face extinction. The frequency of mutation among the Niktos has sped up their evolutoin, altering their genome thousands of times faster than would otherwise be the case. The Niktos are capable of only very limited facial expression due to their lack of well-developed mimetic musculature, and their eyes are protected by a thin, transparent membrane. Their  seemingly blank expressions and unblinking stares often cause others to underestimate their intelligence.","brawn":3,"agility":2,"intellect":2,"cunning":2,"willpower":2,"presence":1,"startXP":100,"wounds":11,"strain":10,"startSkills":"Each subspecies has its own starting skills and special abilities, see Lords of Nal Hutta p.97-98","specialAbilities":""}}}}
