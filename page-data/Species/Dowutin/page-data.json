Although humanoid in form, Dowutins have as much in common with banthas and dewback as with any human or near-human species. Vestigial tusks, although ineffective as weapons, are a reminder of the Dowutins' ancestors, omnivorous herd beasts taht roamed the frigit plain of Dowut. These tusks helped the creatures to forage for roots, insects, and hibernating feeks. Dowutins are more sophisticated in their diets, and many put their great strength and stamina to use as hunters, rather than as foragers. Dowutins' fingers end in thick, tough spikes - the word \"claw\" hardly does them justice - made of the same bony material as their tusks. Although problematic for delicate manual tasks, these talons provide an effective means of self=defense and even augment the Dowutins' considerable strength, whether for prying apart bulkhead doors or dismantling a troublesome droid bare-handed.","brawn":3,"agility":1,"intellect":2,"cunning":2,"willpower":2,"presence":2,"startXP":85,"wounds":15,"strain":8,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in Resilience.","specialAbilities":"At character creation, choose to have silhouette 1 or 2.
