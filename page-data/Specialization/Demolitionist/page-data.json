They are also suited to much more than straightforward combat. They can excel at setting traps, from improvised trip-wires tied to grenades to sophisticated proximity and timed explosives. Whereas another Hired Gun might go after an enemy in a straight-up fight, a Demolitionist may find a more inventive route, such as rigging a thermal detonator to explode when the target starts up his speeder. Some Demolitionists enjoy the thrill of combat as much as any other Hired Gun, however they favor flame projectors, grenade launchers, and missile tubes - anything that creates a large blast.","careerSkills":["Computers","Cool","Mechanics","Skulduggery"],"talents":[{"name":"Powerful Blast","description":"Increase Blast damage deal by explosives, explosive weapons, and grenades by 1 per rank of Powerful Blast.","column":1,"row":1,"passive":true,"connections":[false,false,false,true]},{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 Strain Threshold","column":2,"row":1,"passive":true,"connections":[false,false,false,true]},{"name":"Selective Detonation","description":"When using a weapon with the Blast quality, spend 1 Advantage to exclude 1 target that would be affected by the explosion, up to ranks in Selective Detonation.","column":3,"row":1,"passive":false,"connections":[false,false,false,false]},{"name":"Steady Nerves","description":"Remove 1 Setback per rank of Steady Nerves from Cool or Skulduggery checks.","column":4,"row":1,"passive":true,"connections":[false,false,false,true]},{"name":"Toughened","description":"Gain +2 Wound Threshold","column":1,"row":2,"passive":true,"connections":[false,true,false,true]},{"name":"Time to Go","description":"May spend 1 Destiny Point to perform a Move maneuver as an incidental to attempt to move into cover or out of the blast range of a weapon or explosion.","column":2,"row":2,"passive":false,"connections":[false,true,false,true]},{"name":"Powerful Blast","description":"Increase Blast damage deal by explosives, explosive weapons, and grenades by 1 per rank of Powerful Blast.","column":3,"row":2,"passive":true,"connections":[false,false,true,true]},{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 Strain Threshold","column":4,"row":2,"passive":true,"connections":[true,true,false,true]},{"name":"Enduring","description":"Gain +1 Soak Value","column":1,"row":3,"passive":true,"connections":[false,true,false,true]},{"name":"Improved Time to Go","description":"When activating Time to Go, allow 1 engaged ally to also perform an out of turn Move maneuver as an incidental to attempt to move into cover or out of the blast range of a weapon or explosion.","column":2,"row":3,"passive":false,"connections":[false,true,false,false]},{"name":"Steady Nerves","description":"Remove 1 Setback per rank of Steady Nerves from Cool or Skulduggery checks.","column":3,"row":3,"passive":true,"connections":[false,true,false,true]},{"name":"Rapid Reaction","description":"Suffer a number of strain no greater than ranks in Rapid Reaction, then add an equal number of Success to initiative checks.","column":4,"row":3,"passive":false,"connections":[false,true,false,true]},{"name":"Improvised Detonation","description":"Once per session, make a Hard Mechanics check to perform the Improvised Detonation action and build an explosive device, dealing damage equal to ranks in Intellect + ranks in Mechanics + Damage","column":1,"row":4,"passive":false,"connections":[false,true,true,true]},{"name":"Powerful Blast","description":"Increase Blast damage deal by explosives, explosive weapons, and grenades by 1 per rank of Powerful Blast.","column":2,"row":4,"passive":true,"connections":[true,false,true,false]},{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 Strain Threshold","column":3,"row":4,"passive":true,"connections":[true,true,true,true]},{"name":"Selective Detonation","description":"When using a weapon with the Blast quality, spend 1 Advantage to exclude 1 target that would be affected by the explosion, up to ranks in Selective Detonation.","column":4,"row":4,"passive":false,"connections":[true,true,false,false]},{"name":"Improved Improvised Detonation","description":"Reduce the difficulty of Improvised Detonation's check to Average and increase damage to twice ranks in Mechanics.","column":1,"row":5,"passive":false,"connections":[false,true,false,false]},{"name":"Dedication","description":"Gain +1 to a single characteristic.
