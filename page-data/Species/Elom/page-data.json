They are short and have a solid, stocky build, with large hands and feet that end in large curved claws. They are adept at digging underground, using their clawed hands and prehensile clawed toes. They have wide heads with short, stubby eye stalks on either side. Their dependence on centuries of phosphorescent light underground enables them to see very well in dim light, but this makes them very sensitive to the bright light of the surface world. The Eloms have a pair of closely set tusks low on their face, with nasal features set high between their eyes. The Eloms regulate their body temperature though a combination of rough, oily fur and layers of fat. They are herbivorous and are particularly adapted to eating the unusual plants and fungy that can be found or cultivated underground on their home planet, also named Elom.","brawn":3,"agility":2,"intellect":2,"cunning":2,"willpower":2,"presence":1,"startXP":100,"wounds":10,"strain":9,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in Resilience.","specialAbilities":"Before using a maneuver to move, can spend a maneuver to dig, allowing one to use that move maneuver to travel through loose soil or similar terrain."}}}}
