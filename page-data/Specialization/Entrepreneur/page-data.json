Most savvy businesspeople know that if one only plays by the rules, then one can only ever be as successful as the rules allow. Since the rules are usually written by the established corporations the Entrepreneur competes against, he believes the rules exist solely as a means to restrict progress, stifle innovation, and suppress competition. In short, rules were made to be broken. Even the most upstanding businessperson occasionally contracts operatives for industrial espionage or corporate intelligence gathering, and even if he morally objects to that behavior, he needs to know how to defend against it.","careerSkills":["Discipline","Knowledge (Education)","Knowledge (Underworld)","Negotiation"],"talents":[{"name":"Sound Investments","description":"At the start of each session, gain 100 credits for reach rank of Sound Investments.","column":1,"row":1,"passive":true,"connections":[false,false,false,true]},{"name":"Plausible Deniability","description":"Remove 1 Setback per rank of Plausible Deniability from all Coercion and Deception checks.","column":2,"row":1,"passive":true,"connections":[false,false,false,false]},{"name":"Rapid Recovery","description":"When healing strain after an encounter, heal 1 additional strain per rank of Rapid Recovery.","column":3,"row":1,"passive":true,"connections":[false,false,false,true]},{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 Strain Threshold","column":4,"row":1,"passive":true,"connections":[false,false,false,false]},{"name":"Rapid Recovery","description":"When healing strain after an encounter, heal 1 additional strain per rank of Rapid Recovery.","column":1,"row":2,"passive":true,"connections":[false,true,true,true]},{"name":"Wheel and Deal","description":"When selling goods legally, gain 10% more credits per rank of Wheel and Deal.","column":2,"row":2,"passive":true,"connections":[true,false,false,true]},{"name":"Sound Investments","description":"At the start of each session, gain 100 credits for reach rank of Sound Investments.","column":3,"row":2,"passive":true,"connections":[false,true,true,true]},{"name":"Wheel and Deal","description":"When selling goods legally, gain 10% more credits per rank of Wheel and Deal.","column":4,"row":2,"passive":true,"connections":[true,false,false,true]},{"name":"Greased Palms","description":"Before making a social check, may spend up to 50 credits per rank of Greased Palms to upgrade the ability of the check one for every 50 spent.","column":1,"row":3,"passive":false,"connections":[false,true,true,true]},{"name":"Throwing Credits","description":"At beginning of session, spend 100 credits to ignore strain threshold penalty due to triggered Obligation.","column":2,"row":3,"passive":false,"connections":[true,true,false,false]},{"name":"Bought Info","description":"Instead of making a Knowledge check, may take a Bought Info action: spend credits equal to 50 times the difficulty of the check to pass with 1 Success.","column":3,"row":3,"passive":false,"connections":[false,true,true,false]},{"name":"Sound Investments","description":"At the start of each session, gain 100 credits for reach rank of Sound Investments.","column":4,"row":3,"passive":true,"connections":[true,true,false,true]},{"name":"Sound Investments","description":"At the start of each session, gain 100 credits for reach rank of Sound Investments.","column":1,"row":4,"passive":true,"connections":[false,true,true,true]},{"name":"Toughened","description":"Gain +2 Wound Threshold","column":2,"row":4,"passive":true,"connections":[true,false,false,true]},{"name":"Master Merchant","description":"When buying or selling goods, or paying off or taking Obligation, may suffer 2 strain to sell for 25% more, buy for 25% less, pay off 1 more Obligation, or take 1 less.","column":3,"row":4,"passive":false,"connections":[false,false,true,false]},{"name":"Know Somebody","description":"Once per session, when attempting to purchase a legally available item, reduce its rarity by 1 per rank of Know Somebody.","column":4,"row":4,"passive":false,"connections":[true,true,false,true]},{"name":"Natural Merchant","description":"Once per session, may re-roll any 1 Streetwise or Negotiation check.","column":1,"row":5,"passive":false,"connections":[false,true,true,false]},{"name":"Intense Focus","description":"Perform an Intense Focus maneuver: suffer 1 strain and upgrade the ability of the next skill check once.","column":2,"row":5,"passive":false,"connections":[true,true,true,false]},{"name":"Dedication","description":"Gain +1 to a single characteristic.
