They are lean and gaunt, with sharp features and long limbs. Elongated fingers end in sharp, clawlike nails. Their bodies are hairless, with gray skin and deep-set eyes rimmed in red. Their appearance is that of a predator and isntantly strikes fear into most other beings. This is accentuated by a lipless mouth filled with a row of sharp fangs. Pau'ans have extremely sensitive hearing and typically wear circular coverings over their small ears to provide protection from high volumes. They wear this protection at all times. Loud noises, such as sudden explosions or the din of music blasting from cantina speakers, thend to make them uncomfortable or even cause them pain if they are unprotected. Countless generations of living in the dark underground cities of Utapau have provided them with sharpened vision as well, allowing them to see with ease in all but pitch darkness.","brawn":1,"agility":2,"intellect":2,"cunning":2,"willpower":3,"presence":2,"startXP":95,"wounds":12,"strain":8,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in Negotiation or Coercion.","specialAbilities":"Add 1 Boost to all Perception and Vigilance checks as long as one is wearing one's protective earpieces.
