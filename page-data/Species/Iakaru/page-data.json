Long, bushy eyebrows protect their two dark eyes and provide Iakaru with an instinctive sense of a number of environmental factors, including relative movement, wind speed, and even atmospheric pressure. An incredible sure-footed agility, tuned by millennia of gauging death-defying leaps and swings through the dense jungles of Iakar, complements their keep spatial awareness.
