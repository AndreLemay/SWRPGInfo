Their lower legs bend backward, and they walk on three-toed feet. Their forearms are shorter than their lower extremities and end in three fingers and a thumb.

Bardottans vary substantially in height at maturity, ranging from just over a meter to more than two meters tall. Their skin tones range from pale gray to yellow, green, and even purple.
