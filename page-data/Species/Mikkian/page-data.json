Coloration varies greatly even among closely related Mikkians, and more often than not, siblings or parents and children are completely different colors. Mikkians' features are typical of most humanoid species, with the notable exception of a lack of ears and the presence of motile head-tendrils. Even more distinctive than their skin tones is the seemingly endless variety in Mikkians' head-tendrils. No two sets are identical; they vary in both number and form, to the extend that many outsiders are surprised to learn any two Mikkians are of the same species. Head-tendrils range from fanlike crests and tape-like ribbons to cylindrical tentacles and membranous fins. Some taper from a broad base to a thin tip, while others are consistent, and they vary in length from a few centimeters up to nearly a half-meter. The number of tendrils on a Mikkian's head similarly ranges from only a handful to dozens.","brawn":1,"agility":2,"intellect":2,"cunning":2,"willpower":3,"presence":2,"startXP":100,"wounds":10,"strain":11,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in Discipline.","specialAbilities":"Add 1 Boost to all Perception checks."}}}}
