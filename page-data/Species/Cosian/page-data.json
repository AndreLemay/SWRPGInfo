Scales ranging from dusky gray-green to bright emerald cover their body, often fading with age. Both their head and long tail are crowned with tufts of hair, which can vary in color from midnight blue to silvery white. Their long faces end in a beaked mouth capped with a broad nose. Their large eyes are orange or yellow, ringed in bony ridges; they have the unique trait of blinking with eyelids that rise up from the bottom of their sockets. As they age, many Cosians grow a great beard of long white down from their beaked chin. The Nu-Cosian sub-species does not have the more common beaked mouth and walks in an almost completely hunced manner, but is capable of carrying great loads of weight upon its strong back. Is is otherwise similar to its more common cousin.","brawn":1,"agility":2,"intellect":3,"cunning":2,"willpower":2,"presence":2,"startXP":95,"wounds":10,"strain":11,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in Knowledge (Lore).","specialAbilities":"Encumbrance threshold is 10 + Brawn"}}}}
