Their skin color ranges from red to green, and a pair of pointed horns dominate the maile Devaronian's head; commonly, females have dark, vestigial spots in the same location as the male's horns. Devaronians' mouths are filled with sharp pointed teeth, particularly effective at rending the meat that dominates their diets. Besides these identifying characteristics, Devaronians have a great many physiological similarities to humans - though few observers would confuse the two species. Devaronians have black, silver-based blood. This unusual trait is linked to their particularly thorough blood filtration and cleansing system. Members of the species possess two livers, which constantly cleanse the body of toxins and carcinogens. This grants them an exceptionally high resistance to poisons, also enabling them to consume foods that are toic to other species. Devaronian physiological quirks cause sulfur to be a particularly effetcive stimulant (unlike for most other oxygen-breating species, who find sulfur extremely unpleasant when inhaled). When a Devaronian breathes in sulfur, the substance rapidly enters the bloodstream. granting the Devaronian a burst of prodigious strength and speed. However, sulfur is one element that their livers cannot cleanse as effectively over the long term. Extended exposure to sulfur can have serious medical consequences for a Devaronian.","brawn":2,"agility":2,"intellect":2,"cunning":3,"willpower":2,"presence":1,"startXP":95,"wounds":11,"strain":10,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in Survival or Deception.","specialAbilities":"Add automatic 1 Success to all Resilience checks."}}}}
