Adult females average about two meters tall, making them significantly taller than most humans, with slightly longer arms and legs. Males of hte species tend to be smaller and weaker than the females. Selonians have strong tails about a half meter long that they use to counterbalance themselves when walking upright. Though generally bipedal, Selonians can move comfortably on four limbs, and their retractable claws can be used for digging and burrowing, climbing, or defense. Most Selonians are sterile females, with only one fertile female per den, and relatively few males.","brawn":2,"agility":3,"intellect":2,"cunning":1,"willpower":3,"presence":1,"startXP":80,"wounds":11,"strain":10,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in Coordination.","specialAbilities":"Remove 1 Setback added to checks due to darkness.
