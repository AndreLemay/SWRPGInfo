{"componentChunkName":"component---src-templates-species-tsx","path":"/Species/Chagrian","result":{"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"species":{"name":"Chagrian","description":"Chagians begin their lives in an immature tadpole form some thirty centimeters in length. Born in clutches of two or three siblings, they are cared for by their parents in sealed tubs kept within the home. As they mature, Chagrian children develop arms, legs, and lungs that allow them to breathe air. Once their limbs are fully developed, young Chagrians leave the water, and the last vestiges of their intermediate physiology begin to fade away. Adult Chagrians are humanoid and stand two meters tall on average. They possess powerful, muscular bodies well suited to swimming and heavy labor. As a result of their homeworld's exposure to an unstable sun during their species' evolution, Chagrian skin runs the gamut from light blue to cerulean to indigo, and it provides them with an innate resistance to harmful radiation. Though their planet's sun has been stable for millennia, this radiation resistance has become a dominant trait of their species. Chagrians possess elegant horns growing down from the sides of their heads. Males possess a second set atop their skulls, called lethorns. Once used during mating rituals, the horns were also employed as weapons during formal duels. Though duels for mates have since been outlawed, Chagrians, especially males, consider their horns a sign of status. A large portion of Chagrian daily personal ritual consists of caring for their horns, filing and decorating them in an otherwise uncharacteristic display of vanity.","brawn":2,"agility":1,"intellect":2,"cunning":2,"willpower":3,"presence":2,"startXP":90,"wounds":11,"strain":10,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in Resilience and 1 rank in the Knowledge Specialization talent.","specialAbilities":"Can breathe underwater without penalty and never suffer movement penalties for traveling through water."}}}}
