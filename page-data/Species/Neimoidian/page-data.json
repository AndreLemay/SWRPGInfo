Both species are smooth-skinned hairless humanoids with large red eyes and blue-freen skin, and both species hatch from eggs in a larval \"grub\" stage. A closer look reveals more gray tones in Neimoidian skin. Additoinally, Neimoidians' pupils split horizontally, and their distinct skeletal structure creates protrusions on their foreheads.","brawn":1,"agility":2,"intellect":3,"cunning":3,"willpower":1,"presence":2,"startXP":90,"wounds":11,"strain":9,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in either Deception or Negotiation","specialAbilities":""}}}}
