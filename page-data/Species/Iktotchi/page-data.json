{"componentChunkName":"component---src-templates-species-tsx","path":"/Species/Iktotchi","result":{"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"species":{"name":"Iktotchi","description":"On a basic level, Iktotchi follow what many consider to be a standard pattern for sentients in the galaxy: two legs. two arms, and a head, all connected by a torso. They stand approximately 1.8 meters high on average, and typically have a brown. orange, or pink hue to their skin. In modern society, their twin horns serve no major practical purpose. The horns of male Iktotchi tend to grow larger than those of female Iktotchi, though this is by no means an exact indicator of any individual's sex or gender. Should an Iktotchi's horns become damaged, they grow back over time in most cases. Also notable are their hands, which are almost half again as large as those of most similarly sized species, with relatively thick fingers. Members of the species enjoy a ninety-year life expectancy, given ideal conditions. Iktotchi possess precognitive abilities that they can hone through training, although these are considerably reduced in effectiveness away from their homeworld, the desolate moon called Iktotch. Some Iktotchi have also been reported to possess telepathic capabilities, but whether these Iktotchi actually have a gift for reading minds or can simply extrapolate others' thoughts by perceiving the future remains unclear to xenobiologists. To the Iktotchi themselves, for whom time does not appear as linear as it does to most other species, the practical distinction between clairvoyance and telepathy is often blurry or irrelevant. Most humans do not seek to understand the biological principles that allow their eyes to transform light into coherent images; to most Iktotchi, precognition is as important yet mundane as sight. Iktotchi who hone their gift of foresight can grow extremely skilled as seers, however, and often hold positions of prestige in society.","brawn":2,"agility":2,"intellect":2,"cunning":2,"willpower":3,"presence":1,"startXP":90,"wounds":10,"strain":12,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in Vigilance.","specialAbilities":"May spend 1 Triumph on a check to determine initiative to perform a free maneuver before the encounter begins or to have an ally in short range perform a free maneuver before the encounter begins."}}}}
