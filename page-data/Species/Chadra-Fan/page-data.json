As a species, Chadra-Fan are small, rodent-faced humanoids covered in short, thick fur, ranging in color from a light tan to dark umber or black. Their faces have large balck eyes, massive, bat-like ears, and four nostrils at the end of a short snout, which ends in buckteeth. Chadra-Fan sometimes wear long dresses and smocks over their furry bodies, though they are just as often seen wearing little more than a tool belt. Chadra-Fan have sharp senses. Their vision extends into the infrared range, and their hearing likewise extends into much higher ranges than most humanoids. Their upper nostrils are chemoreceptive, enabling them to sample pheromones, which they can also exude. These scent markers are crucial in distinguishing males from females, and in Chadra-Fan couting rituals. Chadra-Fan metabolish is very high, and their slee pcycles is divided into brief, two-hour naps.","brawn":1,"agility":3,"intellect":3,"cunning":2,"willpower":1,"presence":2,"startXP":90,"wounds":9,"strain":11,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in Mechanics.","specialAbilities":"Smaller than average, and count as silhouette 0.
