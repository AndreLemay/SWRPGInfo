Their desert homeworld results in coarse, hardened skin geenrally colored in shades of brown to black. Adding to their reputation for grim narrow-mindedness, Weequay faces are rigid and lipless, with a bony frill or crest down either jawline. Males encountered off their homeworld keep their hair in a single topknot composed of multiple braids, traditionally one for each of their native years spent away from home. Less traditional males, however, might not follow this. Weequays' eyes are sunk deeply in the folds and creases of their weathered facse providing better protectoin from harsh sunlight.","brawn":3,"agility":2,"intellect":1,"cunning":3,"willpower":2,"presence":1,"startXP":90,"wounds":10,"strain":9,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in Resilience or 1 rank in Athletics.","specialAbilities":"Can communicate with other Weequays in short range using pheromones.
