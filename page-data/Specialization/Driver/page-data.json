Companies, military and security units, governments, and criminal factions all have a regular need for those who can transport personnel and goods over a planet's surface. Additionally, more than a few planets in the Outer Rim have traditions of racing of one style or another, and Drivers are naturals for being able to enter such competitions and walk away with a decent purse. Naturally, this depends on their skill and their ability to avoid being killed by other Drivers.","careerSkills":["Cool","Gunnery","Mechanics","Piloting (Planetary)"],"talents":[{"name":"Full Throttle","description":"Take a Full Throttle action: make a Hard Piloting check ot increase a vehicle's top speed by 1 for a number of rounds equal to Cunning.","column":1,"row":1,"passive":false,"connections":[false,false,false,true]},{"name":"All-Terrain Driver","description":"Do not suffer usual penalties for driving through difficulty terrain when using Piloting (Planetary).","column":2,"row":1,"passive":true,"connections":[false,false,false,false]},{"name":"Fine Tuning","description":"When reducing the amount of system strain a starship or vehicle suffers, reduce 1 additional strain per rank of Fine Tuning.","column":3,"row":1,"passive":true,"connections":[false,false,false,false]},{"name":"Gearhead","description":"Remove 1 Setback per rank of Gearhead from Mechanics checks.
