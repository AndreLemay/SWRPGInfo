Though of short stature, Lannik are a hardy folk with a dense skeletal structure. Despite the fact that their bodies appear thin and delicate, their solid bones more than make up for their slight frames. They are often underestimated at first glance, but such misconceptions rarely last long, especially in combat. As small as they are, Lannik rarely smile, which has given weight to the rumor that they lack the ability to do so. Aside from their height, the most obvious physical feature of the Lannik is their long ears, which droop down to either side of their head. Lannik skin color is usually pale, with subtle tones ranging from red to orange, and from blue to purple. Their body hair tends to blend with their skin tones, while the hair on their head is localized at the top of hte head nad down to the nape of their neck. Warriors grow their hair long, wearing it in a traditional topknot when in service to their lieges. Noncombatants - even those trained for war who are not currently enlisted - wear their hair either short or braided.","brawn":2,"agility":1,"intellect":3,"cunning":2,"willpower":2,"presence":2,"startXP":95,"wounds":8,"strain":12,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in Streetwise.","specialAbilities":"Remove up to 1 Setback caused by Critical Injuries, fear, or the disoriented condition from all checks."}}}}
