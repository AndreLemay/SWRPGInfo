Over a dozen distinct subspecies of the Gands have been reported. All are covered in a denes chitinous exoskeleton and reach a height at adulthood of about 1.6 meters. They have three fingers on each hand, which are as dextrous as those of other humanoids, allowing them to manipulate equipment designed for five-fingered individuals. Where Gand subspecies differ from one another is in their respiratory biology. Most Gands who travel the spacelanes do not seem to need to breathe at all. The digestion of food in their stomachs produces the ammonia necessary for their biochemistry. Wasteful byproducts and extraneous ammonia are expelled through their exoskeletons. These Gands often emanate an unpleasant methane musk. Other Gand subspecies possess actual lungs and cannot produce ammonia through digestion, instead requiring a special breathing apparatus.","brawn":2,"agility":2,"intellect":2,"cunning":2,"willpower":3,"presence":1,"startXP":100,"wounds":10,"strain":10,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in Discipline.","specialAbilities":"Lungless Gand are immune to suffocation (but not the wounds suffered from exposure to vacuum). Lunged Gand begin the game with an ammonia respirator and treat oxygen as a dangerous atmosphere with rating 8, but gain +10 starting XP."}}}}
