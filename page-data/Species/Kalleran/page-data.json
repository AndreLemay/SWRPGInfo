They are slim for their height, though their physiques tend to be flexible rather than spindly. Kalleran feet and hands each have three fully prehensile digits, arranged in a radial manner. They do not normally wear shoes, preferring not to restrict their ability to grasp with their feet. Their green skin often has distinctive black markings, which vary in pattern by individual.","brawn":3,"agility":2,"intellect":2,"cunning":2,"willpower":2,"presence":1,"startXP":90,"wounds":8,"strain":12,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in Streetwise and the Heightened Awareness talent.","specialAbilities":""}}}}
