Over decades, centuries, and millenia, these combat forms become more than mere means of inflicting violence, generations of practicioners work to make them into art forms, philosophies, and ways of life. A desire to practice self-defense can become a belief in the value of self-betterment and the innate potential of others, though not all ideologies develop along such lines. More than a few Bounty Hunters have picked up techniques from martial arts styles across the galaxy to help in their hunts. Some are shining examples of their school's philosophies and traditions, but others are disgraced students, or have never even trained formally, earning their skills through hard experience on the battlefield.","careerSkills":["Athletics","Brawl","Coordination","Discipline"],"talents":[{"name":"Iron Body","description":"Remove 1 Setback per rank of Iron Body from Coordination and Resilience checks.
