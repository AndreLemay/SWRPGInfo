Away from their homeworld, they are occasionally mistaken for Zabraks, who are more common across the galaxy. The Elomin have large, pointed ears and nearly solid-colored, bright eyes of a wide variety of hues. Their skin color ranges from black to brighter shades of red. Their fingers have small sharp, claw-like nails. Despite long involvement in the Republic and the Empire, many Elomin prefer working on their own or with other Elomin whenever possible. These xenophobic tendencies also play into their dealings with the Eloms. However, in spite of their insular societal tendencies, many individual Elomin are driven by a thirst for knowledge that takes them into the wider galaxy.","brawn":2,"agility":2,"intellect":3,"cunning":2,"willpower":1,"presence":2,"startXP":105,"wounds":9,"strain":10,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in Knowledge (Education)","specialAbilities":""}}}}
