He can talk to anyone about anything in any necessary way. What others accomplish with might and fear, a talented Politico may well achieve with a few well-placed words and a decent plan. Politicos in the Outer Rim are usually up to something; ambition is hardwired into their very being. They may not yet know what they wish to accomplish, but when they see an opportunity to achieve some kind of greater goal, they will turn all their will and personality towards acheiving it. Politicos might sign on to temporarily work for another, but they will not long be happy in a subservient role. Leadership is the core of who they are. In a group, the Politico works best as the front-man, or the \"face\". More than anyone, he is best suited for initial contacts with any being or group, and hes' the best to have at any negotiation, social gathering, or interrogation. There are even times when he can bring up morale in combat and crisis situations, though the palace throne room, corporate board room, or casino floor tend to be better battlefields for him.","careerSkills":["Charm","Coercion","Deception","Knowledge (Core Worlds)"],"talents":[{"name":"Kill with Kindness","description":"Remove 1 Setback per rank of Kill with Kindness from all Charm and Leadership checks.","column":1,"row":1,"passive":true,"connections":[false,false,false,true]},{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 Strain Threshold","column":2,"row":1,"passive":true,"connections":[false,false,false,true]},{"name":"Plausible Deniability","description":"Remove 1 Setback per rank of Plausible Deniability from all Coercion and Deception checks.","column":3,"row":1,"passive":true,"connections":[false,false,false,true]},{"name":"Toughened","description":"Gain +2 Wound Threshold","column":4,"row":1,"passive":true,"connections":[false,false,false,true]},{"name":"Inspiring Rhetoric","description":"Take the Inspiring Rhetoric action: make an Average Leadership check.
