{"componentChunkName":"component---src-templates-species-tsx","path":"/Species/Ishi Tib","result":{"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"species":{"name":"Ishi Tib","description":"Ishi Tib are amphibious humanoids who possess leathery green skin and two eyestalks that extend from their heads at a somewhat jaunty angle. Their eyes are typically yellow with slitted pupils, though colors such as orange and yellow-green have also been observed. Ishi Tib faces also feature two pouch-like cheeks, which are used to store food such as algae, microscopic organisms, and small crustaceans. In the center of the face is a powerful beak-like mouth. While Ishi Tib commonly use their beaks to crack open crustacean exoskeletons or shellfish shells, their mouthparts can also provide an improvised weapon in dire circumstances. The bodies of Ishi Tib are bulky and muscular. Their thick limbs end in two-fingered hands and fin-like feet that allow them to swim unimpeded through the water. Though their thick skin is resistant to water evaporation, the Ishi Tib are forever tied to the seas of their homeworld. To prevent their bodies from drying out, Ishi Tib must regularly immerse themselves in a saline liquid similar to that of Tibrin's oceans. Failure to see to this basic need can result in disability and death, often within a matter of days.","brawn":2,"agility":2,"intellect":3,"cunning":2,"willpower":1,"presence":2,"startXP":100,"wounds":12,"strain":10,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in Discipline.","specialAbilities":"Can breathe underwater without penalty and never suffer movement penalties for traveling through water.
