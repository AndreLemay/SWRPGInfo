Given this ability to skillfully alter bodies with cybernetics, most Cyber Techs perform at least some upgrades on themselves. The degree and subtlety of an individual Cyber Tech's upgrades tend to depend on the individual's culture, species, and personal beliefs. Within some cultures, extensive cybernetic augmentation is considered unusual or even taboo.","careerSkills":["Athletics","Mechanics","Medicine","Vigilance"],"talents":[{"name":"Cyberneticist","description":"Remove 1 Setback per rank of Cyberneticist from checks to build, repair, and install cybernetic implants.
