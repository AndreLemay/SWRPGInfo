From heavy blasters to missile tubes, Heavies favor big, loud, and devastating weaponry. Using such weapons is often punishing for the wielder, and characters must possess great fortitude in order to wield such weapons extensively. A high Resilience is often a side effect of the Heavy's actions, rather than the result of conscious training. Lugging around heavy weapons builds stamina, and simply dealing with the recoil provides a workout.","careerSkills":["Gunnery","Perception","Ranged (Heavy)","Resilience"],"talents":[{"name":"Burly","description":"Reduce any wielded weapon's Cumbersome quality and Encumbrance rating by a number equal to ranks in Burly, to a minimum of 1.","column":1,"row":1,"passive":true,"connections":[false,false,false,true]},{"name":"Barrage","description":"Add 1 damage per rank of Barrage to 1 hit of successful attack while using Ranged (Heavy) or Gunnery skills at long or extreme range.","column":2,"row":1,"passive":true,"connections":[false,false,false,true]},{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 Strain Threshold","column":3,"row":1,"passive":true,"connections":[false,false,false,false]},{"name":"Toughened","description":"Gain +2 Wound Threshold","column":4,"row":1,"passive":true,"connections":[false,false,false,true]},{"name":"Barrage","description":"Add 1 damage per rank of Barrage to 1 hit of successful attack while using Ranged (Heavy) or Gunnery skills at long or extreme range.","column":1,"row":2,"passive":true,"connections":[false,true,true,false]},{"name":"Brace","description":"Perform the Brace maneuver to remove 1 Setback per rank of Brace from next Action.
