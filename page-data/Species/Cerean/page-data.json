The most notable differences are the presence of the enlarged, conical cranium - to accommodate teh binary brain structure - as well as a pair of hearts to improve blood circulation. Cereans are generally regarded as somewhat less physically coordinated than humans. Cereans exhibit an unusual sexual dimorphism. Female births outnumber male births by a ratio of twenty to one. Further, males age more rapidly than females. Consequently, female Cereans dominate the world's population.","brawn":2,"agility":1,"intellect":3,"cunning":2,"willpower":2,"presence":2,"startXP":90,"wounds":10,"strain":13,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in Vigilance.","specialAbilities":"Treat all Knowledge skills as career skills."}}}}
