The noses at the end of their tapered snouts can distinguish many smells, and their eyes have an extended range of focus. They possess ears double the size of most species and can rotate and bend them to pick up directional sounds. Standing on average 1.6 meters, their small size allows Bothans to often go unnoticed and slip throgh cracks that would never fit a human. Their greatest asset is their fur. They can communicate with other Bothans by rippling their fur, demonstrating changes in mood and conveying more specific intimations in a code.","brawn":1,"agility":2,"intellect":2,"cunning":3,"willpower":2,"presence":2,"startXP":100,"wounds":10,"strain":11,"startSkills":"Begin game with 1 rank in Streetwise, and 1 rank in the Convincing Demeanor talent.","specialAbilities":""}}}}
