They stand slightly shorter than humans. They are excellent swimmers (though they strongly dislike salt water) and dine on a variety of insects, fish, and algae. To reproduce, Drabatans lay eggs that hatch tadpoles in silty pond soil. Over the course of a year, the tadpoles grow and assume bipedal features before emerging as child-sized Drabatans. They also develop large lungs and strong diaphragms, which enabled them to achieve powerful vocals while singing or shouting.","brawn":2,"agility":2,"intellect":2,"cunning":1,"willpower":2,"presence":3,"startXP":100,"wounds":10,"strain":10,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in either Charm or Leadership.","specialAbilities":"When making a Leadership or Coercion check, can spend 2 Advantage to affect 1 additional character not originally targeted by the check or affect targets at one range band further than normal."}}}}
