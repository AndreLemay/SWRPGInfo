Zabrak vestigial horns emerge at puberty; they are a sign that an individual is reaching maturation and nearing the age of the traditional rite of passage. Zabrak skin colors range from near-ivory through browns to near-black, in a broad range of tones. Some have hair, but many are completely bald. Eye colors include the common human range, but can also include yellow, red, and orange.","brawn":2,"agility":2,"intellect":2,"cunning":2,"willpower":3,"presence":1,"startXP":100,"wounds":10,"strain":10,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in Survival.","specialAbilities":"Add automatic 1 Advantage to all Coercion checks."}}}}
