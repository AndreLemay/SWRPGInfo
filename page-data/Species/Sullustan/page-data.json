Their skin is generally pink in tone, with very little body hair. Their height tends to fall within 1 to 1.8 meters. They have large, dark eyes; large, rounded ears; and notable flaps of skin that extend down from theircheeks and are called \"dewflaps\". Evolving on a volcanic planet with a thorougly unhospitable surface, the Sullustans became subterranean beings who thrived in the caves and tunnels beneath Sullust's unstable outer crust. Their adaptations give them exceptional hearing, including the ability ot determine distances and directions via audio cues. Their eyes are such that they can see up to twenty meters even in total darkness. Unfortunately, this means most Sullustans start to suffer serious corneal damage when exposed to natural light over extended periods of time. Another evolutionary adaptation enables all Sullustans to always know what direction they are going, regardless of conditions or lack of physical signs. This ability allows the species to navigate the complex warrens and tunnel networks they live in. For reasons not yet fully understood, this natural direction sense in any situation extends all the way to space travel, even including hyperspace navigation.","brawn":2,"agility":3,"intellect":2,"cunning":1,"willpower":2,"presence":2,"startXP":100,"wounds":10,"strain":10,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in Astrogation and 1 rank in the Skilled Jockey talent.","specialAbilities":""}}}}
