Their height ranges between 1.3 and 1.8 meters, and they have a very fish-like appearance, even as bipeds. This includes mottled salmon skin, large wide-directional eyes (which can move independently), webbed hands and feet, and domed skulls. Other species tend to note they have a not-unpleasant smell of sea and salt.","brawn":2,"agility":2,"intellect":3,"cunning":1,"willpower":2,"presence":2,"startXP":100,"wounds":10,"strain":10,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in Knowledge (Education).","specialAbilities":"Can breathe underwater without penalty and never suffers movement penalties for traveling through water."}}}}
