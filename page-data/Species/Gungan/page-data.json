They are tall and thin, averaging nearly two meters in height. Their expressive, long ears and eyestalks are set around a bill-like mouth. They are omnivorous, with a diet composed largely of mollusks and aquatic plants. Gungan compound lungs are capable of efficiently extracting oxygen from both air and water.
