They are quite gangly, and each stands 1.9 meters tall. Their faces are long, with two large black eyes placed above a short snout that terminates in a small, toothless mouth. Two antennae, which act as auditory organs, emerge from the sides of their heads. These antennae are also sensitive to radio-wave transmissions, which Verpine can create organically in order to communicate with other members of their communities. Despite perceptions to the contrar, this form of communication is not telepathing in nature. Verpine bodies are covered in a flexible, nearly elastic form of chitin. This \"carahide\" is typically green, though the specific hue varies from dull olive or brownish-green to a brighter, mossier shade, especially in younger specimens. Despite its relative suppleness, a Verpine's carahide is incredibly tough, and it acts as a form of natural armor, especially against stabbing and slashing attacks. As a Verpine ages, it sheds older or damaged plates of carahide, which are then replaced by newer ones.","brawn":2,"agility":3,"intellect":3,"cunning":1,"willpower":2,"presence":1,"startXP":80,"wounds":9,"strain":12,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in Mechanics.","specialAbilities":"When closely examining an object, add 1 Boost to Perception checks.
