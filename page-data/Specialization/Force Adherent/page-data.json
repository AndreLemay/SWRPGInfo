Whether their seeking is triggered by a general sense of meaninglessness or a specific, personal loss, the idea of the Force is a reassuring constant. For these individuals, the rituals, practices, and holy places of Force worship give direction. Making pilgrimages to established Force locations like Jedha, for instance, is frequently an integral part of these Force Adherents' journeys. However, not all Force Adherents come to their worship for meaning or guidance. To those who have seen or heard about the incredible deeds of Force-users, such as the Jedi, worship of the Force tantalizes with the possibility of unlocking that strength. Unfortunately for those who seek this power, not all individuals are sensitive to the Force. Regardless, those who pursue Force worship earnestly find a strength they can unlock within themselves.","careerSkills":["Melee","Discipline","Knowledge (Lore)","Vigilance"],"talents":[{"name":"Resolve","description":"When a character involuntarily suffers strain, he suffers 1 less strain per rank of Resolve, to a minimum of 1.","column":1,"row":1,"passive":true,"connections":[false,false,false,true]},{"name":"Disciple of Lore","description":"Once per round, may sufer 1 strain to decrease the difficulty of next Knowledge (Lore) check a number of times equal to ranks in Disciple of Lore.","column":2,"row":1,"passive":false,"connections":[false,false,false,true]},{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 Strain Threshold","column":3,"row":1,"passive":true,"connections":[false,false,false,false]},{"name":"Push Aside","description":"After making a successful Melee or Brawl combat check against an engaged foe, may force the foe to move to short range in a direction of the opponent's choosing.
