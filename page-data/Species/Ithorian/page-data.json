At the top of an Ithorian's torso, the neck and head emerge as a continuous, curved structure that reaches forward and ends with a vaguely \"T\"-shaped protrusion. The Ithorian's eyes are large, inset orbs on either end of the structure's \"T\". Back near where the neck emerges from the torso, there is a mouth on either side. With four throats and these two mouths, Ithorians have the capacity to speak and sing in stereo. They possess powerful sonic abilities that can, with effort, be used offensively. Males and females are primarily distinguished by the humps on the back of their heads; one for a male, two for a female. Their young, called \"pupae\", are spawned by the thousands from a single male. At this early stage, Ithorians have no limbs, moving around by use of locomotion tubes. All of this changes after their metamorphosis into young adults.","brawn":2,"agility":1,"intellect":2,"cunning":2,"willpower":3,"presence":2,"startXP":90,"wounds":9,"strain":12,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in Survival.","specialAbilities":"Can suffer 3 strain to use their voice as a weapon with the following profile: (Resilience; Damage 6; Critical 4; Range [Short]; Blast 3, Concussive 1, Slow-Firing 2, Stun Damage)."}}}}
