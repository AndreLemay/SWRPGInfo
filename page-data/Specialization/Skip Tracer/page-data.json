Sometimes, a Bounty Hunter just needs to do some legwork, find a target, and get that individual to pay what is owed with a few well-chosen words. This is the specialty of Skip Tracers, who take on commissions to seek out people with unpaid debts from clients who wish to have items returned, cash given back, or recompense paid in some other way. Most Skip Tracers prefer to keep their guns holstered for the whole job, and try their utmost to avoid causing negotiations with their targets to break down explosively. Property destruction and medical bills cut into the commission, after all. Of course, as most Skip Tracers know all too well, things rarely go so smoothly. More often, the Skip Tracer ends up needing to apply pressure.","careerSkills":["Cool","Knowledge (Underworld)","Negotiation","Skulduggery"],"talents":[{"name":"Bypass Security","description":"Remove 1 Setback per rank of Bypass Security from checks made to disable a security device or open a locked door.","column":1,"row":1,"passive":true,"connections":[false,false,false,true]},{"name":"Hard-Boiled","description":"When recovering strain after an encounter, may spend 1 Advantage up to ranks in Hard-Boiled to recover 1 wound per Advantage spent.","column":2,"row":1,"passive":true,"connections":[false,false,false,true]},{"name":"Good Cop","description":"May spend 2 Advantage from a Charm or Negotiation check to upgrade ability of a single ally's subsequent Social Interaction check against the target a number of times equal to ranks in Good Cop.","column":3,"row":1,"passive":true,"connections":[false,false,false,true]},{"name":"Rapid Recovery","description":"When recovering strain after an encounter, may spend 1 Advantage up to ranks in Hard-Boiled to recover 1 wound per Advantage spent.","column":4,"row":1,"passive":true,"connections":[false,false,false,true]},{"name":"Toughened","description":"Gain +2 Wound Threshold","column":1,"row":2,"passive":true,"connections":[false,true,true,true]},{"name":"Expert Tracker","description":"Remove 1 Setback per rank of Expert Tracker from checks to find tracks or track targets.
