Despite their different methods, Assassins still adhere to many of the same ethics and practices of other Bounty Hunters. They take their work very seriously, avoid all needless bloodshed, and honor their contracts to the letter. Some treat their methods with reverence, even assigning a certain mystique to it. Others simply see themselves as cold killers, and are just fine with it.",

What others accomplish with might and fear, a talented Politico may well achieve with a few well-placed words and a decent plan. Politicos in the Outer Rim are usually up to something; ambition is hardwired into their very being. They may not yet know what they wish to accomplish, but when they see an opportunity to achieve some kind of greater goal, they will turn all their will and personality towards acheiving it. Politicos might sign on to temporarily work for another, but they will not long be happy in a subservient role. Leadership is the core of who they are. In a group, the Politico works best as the front-man, or the \"face\". More than anyone, he is best suited for initial contacts with any being or group, and hes' the best to have at any negotiation, social gathering, or interrogation. There are even times when he can bring up morale in combat and crisis situations, though the palace throne room, corporate board room, or casino floor tend to be better battlefields for him.",

This is especially true when a group is faced with something truly unknown, or needs to find something that simple tracking alone cannot locate. Even in the Outer Rim, there are those who have a keen respect for knowledge and leraning. Even criminal overlords find having some \"brains\" around helps them when they want to expand theri operations or exploit a new opportunity. Other Scholars, however, are far more interested in getting out into the galaxy, seeing for themselves the things they with to study, and digging around in ancient places for the lost konwledge they want to uncover. A Scholar in a group is very likely of the field researcher variety; seeking allies with physical capabilities who can defend him is a matter of somple expediency. It may be that he's signed on with some kind of operation that actually has no direct impact on his research, but the group is likely to travel to places he wishes to go, which suits his desires well.",
