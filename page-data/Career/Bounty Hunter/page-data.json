Despite their different methods, Assassins still adhere to many of the same ethics and practices of other Bounty Hunters. They take their work very seriously, avoid all needless bloodshed, and honor their contracts to the letter. Some treat their methods with reverence, even assigning a certain mystique to it. Others simply see themselves as cold killers, and are just fine with it.","careerSkills":["Melee","Ranged (Heavy)","Skulduggery","Stealth"],"talents":[{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 Strain Threshold","column":1,"row":1,"passive":true,"connections":[false,false,false,true]},{"name":"Lethal Blows","description":"Add +10 per rank of Lethal Blows to any Critical Injury results inflicted on opponents","column":2,"row":1,"passive":true,"connections":[false,false,false,true]},{"name":"Stalker","description":"Add 1 Boost per rank of Stalker to all Stealth and Coordination checks","column":3,"row":1,"passive":true,"connections":[false,false,false,true]},{"name":"Dodge","description":"When targeted by combat check, may perform a Dodge incidental to suffer a number of strain no greater than ranks of Dodge, then upgrade the difficulty of the check by that number","column":4,"row":1,"passive":false,"connections":[false,false,false,true]},{"name":"Precise Aim","description":"Once per round, may perform Precise Aim maneuver.
