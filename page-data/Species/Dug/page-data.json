The genders are very similar in appearance, though males have loose, inflatable neck-flaps reserved for mating rituals anc calls. Dugs have long snouts that most species subconsciously read as expressing a permanent snarl. This perception likely plays into - and also helps to fuel - the Dugs' galactic reputation for confrontational and mean-spirited interaction. Long skin flaps at the ends of their snouts and ears are often adorned with beads or jewelry. Due to their dextrous feet, adapted to grasping branches and trunks in their native forest habitat, Dugs do not generally wear footwear. When they do, it tends to be similar to gloves to allow them to maintain the use of their digits when moving. Malastare's high gravity makes the Dugs especially strong and quick when they are on worlds with gravity at or lower than the galactic average.","brawn":2,"agility":3,"intellect":2,"cunning":2,"willpower":2,"presence":1,"startXP":90,"wounds":9,"strain":8,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in Brawn and 1 rank of the Defensive Driving talent.","specialAbilities":""}}}}
