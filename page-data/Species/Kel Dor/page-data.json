Their respiratory systems are well adapted to Dorin's unusual atmosphere of helium and unique gas compounds, so that they must make use of filtration masks in order to survive in other environments. This, combined with innate toughness, does allow them to survive hard vacuum for a short time, an extraordinarily useful ability. Similarly, they wear protective and enhancing goggles because their black eyes are sensitized to the dim light and unusual atmospheric conditions of Dorin. A highly developed extrasensory organ is located at the back of the Kel Dor skull, tightly linked to the brain. Kel Dor skin tone ranges from a pale orange to a dark red.","brawn":1,"agility":2,"intellect":2,"cunning":2,"willpower":3,"presence":2,"startXP":100,"wounds":10,"strain":10,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in Knowledge (Education).","specialAbilities":"Remove up to 2 Setback imposed due to darkness on all checks.
