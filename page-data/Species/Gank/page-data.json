Their snarling visages and bady eyes give them a dangerous, predatory appearance. Aggressive and belligerent, Ganks are known to have short tempers and few scruples, though they are strongly protective of their own kind. Cybernetics are such an important element of Gank society that they are virtually a part of their physiology, with every Gank having a least a few different implants or proshtetics.","brawn":2,"agility":2,"intellect":2,"cunning":2,"willpower":2,"presence":1,"startXP":110,"wounds":10,"strain":10,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in Coercion or Vigilance.","specialAbilities":"All Ganks are cyborgs; begin with up to 2 sybernetics that cost a total of up to 5000 credits.
