However, with all of the dangers and wonders of \"a thousand thousand worlds,\" having someone around who actually knows something more than how to reload a heavy blaster could be exceedingly useful under any number of circumstances. This is especially true when a group is faced with something truly unknown, or needs to find something that simple tracking alone cannot locate. Even in the Outer Rim, there are those who have a keen respect for knowledge and leraning. Even criminal overlords find having some \"brains\" around helps them when they want to expand theri operations or exploit a new opportunity. Other Scholars, however, are far more interested in getting out into the galaxy, seeing for themselves the things they with to study, and digging around in ancient places for the lost konwledge they want to uncover. A Scholar in a group is very likely of the field researcher variety; seeking allies with physical capabilities who can defend him is a matter of somple expediency. It may be that he's signed on with some kind of operation that actually has no direct impact on his research, but the group is likely to travel to places he wishes to go, which suits his desires well.","careerSkills":["Knowledge (Outer Rim)","Knowledge (Underworld)","Knowledge (Xenology)","Perception"],"talents":[{"name":"Respected Scholar","description":"May downgrade difficulty of checks to interact with institutes of learning by 1 level per rank of Respected Scholar.","column":1,"row":1,"passive":true,"connections":[false,false,false,true]},{"name":"Speaks Binary","description":"When directing NPC droids, may grant them 1 Boost per rank of Speaks Binary on checks.","column":2,"row":1,"passive":true,"connections":[false,false,false,true]},{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 Strain Threshold","column":3,"row":1,"passive":true,"connections":[false,false,false,true]},{"name":"Brace","description":"Perform the Brace maneuver to remove 1 Setback per rank of Brace from next Action.
