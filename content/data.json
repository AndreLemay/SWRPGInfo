			"description": "A hunter who seeks to collect bounties for his work. Bounty Hunters tend to be feared, reviled, looked down upon - and in great demand throughout the galaxy. They are expert trackers, brutal combatants, and effective investigators. They tend to prefer skulduggery, stealth, and traps over frontal assaults, but the most respected Bounty Hunters will do whatever it takes to catch their quarries and collect their fees.",

					"description": "Whereas most Bounty Hunters focus primarily on the capture of quarry, those who specialize as Assassins are generally tasked with the straightforward proposition of terminating their targets. Assassins tend to prefer getting in quietly, taking out targets (either up close or sniping from afar), and leaving just as silently as they entered. Despite their different methods, Assassins still adhere to many of the same ethics and practices of other Bounty Hunters. They take their work very seriously, avoid all needless bloodshed, and honor their contracts to the letter. Some treat their methods with reverence, even assigning a certain mystique to it. Others simply see themselves as cold killers, and are just fine with it.",
