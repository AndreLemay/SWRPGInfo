The taller northern Mustafarians are more vulnerable to damage. Thus, stouter southern Mustafarians more often take on the harsher ork, such as labouring in the Mining Guild's lava extraction operations. Mustafarians are arthropods, with a touch exoskeleton over leathery skin. They are bipedal and somewhat humanoid. They have long snouts and large eyes on either side of their heads. Even unprotected, Mustafarians can anturally withstand far more heat than most species. Though many of their adaptations came about to help them survive the heat, Mustafarians still wear armor and heavy environmental protection gear when outside of hteir underground shelters. They have a limited capability to survive on the surface without survival gear, but rarely put this durability to the test.","brawn":2,"agility":2,"intellect":2,"cunning":2,"willpower":2,"presence":1,"startXP":100,"wounds":10,"strain":10,"startSkills":"Northern Mustafarians begin with 1 rank in the Eye for Detail talent.
