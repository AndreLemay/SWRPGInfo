Most of a Whiphid's body is covered in long, shaggy fur, most typically brown in coloration. Whiphid genders are difficult for most outsiders to discern. All Whiphids are powerfully built and possess long, sharp tusks that extend upward from the massive bottom jaws of their harless faces. Their hands contain two fingers and a thumb, all of which end in deadly claws. As an adaptation to their frozen world, Whiphids naturally develop thicker hair and a dense layer of blubber while living in cold temperatures. Many Whiphids living off-planet therefore appear slightly thinner and less shaggy than their homeworld counterparts, although given adequate exposure to a colder climate, Whiphids regain both the fat and hair. Barring death by illness, conflict, or accident, Whiphids live up to almost two and a half centuries. Given their considerable lifespans, elder Whiphids are sure to have amassed considered wisdom and experience from their long years.","brawn":3,"agility":2,"intellect":2,"cunning":1,"willpower":2,"presence":2,"startXP":80,"wounds":12,"strain":10,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in Survival.","specialAbilities":"Add automatic 1 Success to Survival checks and can survive for several weeks without food.
