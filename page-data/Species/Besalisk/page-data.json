{"componentChunkName":"component---src-templates-species-tsx","path":"/Species/Besalisk","result":{"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"species":{"name":"Besalisk","description":"Besalisks are burlier than members of most other humanoid species, average about 1.8 meters in height, and have thick limbs and a broad neck nearly the size of their wide heads. Their segmented, overlapping head ridge ends in a small beak-like feature where many humanoids have a form of nose. The beak reveals the Besalisk's avian heritage, though new observers could be forgiven for incorrectly perceiving their phsyical features as reptilian. Besalisks deviate from the form of most humanoid species in one major way: they have four powerful arms. One set of arms is primary, and the other is secondary, typically acting in synchronized movements with the first pair. Much like other humanoids, Besalisks also generally have a primary hand; the remaining limbs are typically considered off-hands. They rarely wear footwear, which tends to be unwieldy on their large, three-toed feet. They are adapted to the frigit weather of their homeworld, Ojom, and tend ot perspire heavily in the climates preferred by many of the galaxy's more numerous species.","brawn":3,"agility":1,"intellect":2,"cunning":1,"willpower":2,"presence":2,"startXP":85,"wounds":12,"strain":7,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in Resilience.","specialAbilities":"Gain an additional free maneuver per turn (still limited to 2 maneuvers per turn)."}}}}
