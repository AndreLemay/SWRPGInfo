His ability to identify subtle clues in the body language, mannerisms, voice patterns, and behavior of his opponents gives the Gambler all the information he needs to decide when to make his move. The Gambler prides himself on being unpredictable, denying his opponents any hints to his intentions with this stone-cold expression. Whether the situation is a game of sabacc, betting on podraces, or talking a thug out of blasting his companions, the Gambler has a strategy, and rarely the one people expect.","careerSkills":["Computers","Cool","Deception","Skulduggery"],"talents":[{"name":"Convincing Demeanor","description":"Remove 1 Setback per rank of Convincing Demeanor from Deception or Skulduggery checks.","column":1,"row":1,"passive":true,"connections":[false,false,false,true]},{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 Strain Threshold","column":2,"row":1,"passive":true,"connections":[false,false,false,true]},{"name":"Toughened","description":"Gain +2 Wound Threshold","column":3,"row":1,"passive":true,"connections":[false,false,false,false]},{"name":"Up the Ante","description":"When gambling, win 10% more credits per rank of Up the Ante","column":4,"row":1,"passive":true,"connections":[false,false,false,false]},{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 Strain Threshold","column":1,"row":2,"passive":true,"connections":[false,true,false,true]},{"name":"Second Chances","description":"Once per encounter, choose a number of positive dice equal to ranks in Second Chances and re-roll them.","column":2,"row":2,"passive":false,"connections":[false,true,false,true]},{"name":"Dedication","description":"Gain +1 to a single characteristic.
