Webbed toes and fingers aid them in swimming through the depths. A dense cartilaginous support network combines with a bony endoskeleton to make them exceptionally tough. Lengthy green tendrils emerge from their heads, serving as sensory organs that detect the pheromones of nearby sentients. Their large black eyes are adapted to pierce the murkiest underwater environments. However, Nautolans are capable of surviving for extended periods on dry land.","brawn":3,"agility":2,"intellect":2,"cunning":2,"willpower":1,"presence":2,"startXP":100,"wounds":11,"strain":9,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in Athletics.","specialAbilities":"Can breathe underwater without penalty and never suffer movement penalties for traveling through water."}}}}
