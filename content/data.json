Assassins tend to prefer getting in quietly, taking out targets (either up close or sniping from afar), and leaving just as silently as they entered. Despite their different methods, Assassins still adhere to many of the same ethics and practices of other Bounty Hunters. They take their work very seriously, avoid all needless bloodshed, and honor their contracts to the letter. Some treat their methods with reverence, even assigning a certain mystique to it. Others simply see themselves as cold killers, and are just fine with it.",

However, with all of the dangers and wonders of \"a thousand thousand worlds,\" having someone around who actually knows something more than how to reload a heavy blaster could be exceedingly useful under any number of circumstances. This is especially true when a group is faced with something truly unknown, or needs to find something that simple tracking alone cannot locate. Even in the Outer Rim, there are those who have a keen respect for knowledge and leraning. Even criminal overlords find having some \"brains\" around helps them when they want to expand theri operations or exploit a new opportunity. Other Scholars, however, are far more interested in getting out into the galaxy, seeing for themselves the things they with to study, and digging around in ancient places for the lost konwledge they want to uncover. A Scholar in a group is very likely of the field researcher variety; seeking allies with physical capabilities who can defend him is a matter of somple expediency. It may be that he's signed on with some kind of operation that actually has no direct impact on his research, but the group is likely to travel to places he wishes to go, which suits his desires well.",

They have three fingers on each hand, which are as dextrous as those of other humanoids, allowing them to manipulate equipment designed for five-fingered individuals. Where Gand subspecies differ from one another is in their respiratory biology. Most Gands who travel the spacelanes do not seem to need to breathe at all. The digestion of food in their stomachs produces the ammonia necessary for their biochemistry. Wasteful byproducts and extraneous ammonia are expelled through their exoskeletons. These Gands often emanate an unpleasant methane musk. Other Gand subspecies possess actual lungs and cannot produce ammonia through digestion, instead requiring a special breathing apparatus.",

Most visibly, Sakiyans have enlarged bifurcated craniums, lack any hair, and have pointed ears. Their skin is highly reflective, like burnished metal, and varies in color from jet black and dark grey to varying shades of red, blue, and purple. Pale-skinned and albino Sakiyans exist as well. Nearly twice the size of the average human brain, the highly evolved brains of the Sakiyans are able to process impressive amounts of sensory information. As such, Sakiyans have extraordinary sense: they are able to see int othe infrared spectrium and possess truly exceptional hearing and smell. Some Sakiyan hunters are said to track their prey by smell alone.",

This grants them an exceptionally high resistance to poisons, also enabling them to consume foods that are toic to other species. Devaronian physiological quirks cause sulfur to be a particularly effetcive stimulant (unlike for most other oxygen-breating species, who find sulfur extremely unpleasant when inhaled).

			"description": "Chagians begin their lives in an immature tadpole form some thirty centimeters in length. Born in clutches of two or three siblings, they are cared for by their parents in sealed tubs kept within the home. As they mature, Chagrian children develop arms, legs, and lungs that allow them to breathe air. Once their limbs are fully developed, young Chagrians leave the water, and the last vestiges of their intermediate physiology begin to fade away. Adult Chagrians are humanoid and stand two meters tall on average. They possess powerful, muscular bodies well suited to swimming and heavy labor. As a result of their homeworld's exposure to an unstable sun during their species' evolution, Chagrian skin runs the gamut from light blue to cerulean to indigo, and it provides them with an innate resistance to harmful radiation. Though their planet's sun has been stable for millennia, this radiation resistance has become a dominant trait of their species. Chagrians possess elegant horns growing down from the sides of their heads. Males possess a second set atop their skulls, called lethorns. Once used during mating rituals, the horns were also employed as weapons during formal duels. Though duels for mates have since been outlawed, Chagrians, especially males, consider their horns a sign of status. A large portion of Chagrian daily personal ritual consists of caring for their horns, filing and decorating them in an otherwise uncharacteristic display of vanity.",

While Ishi Tib commonly use their beaks to crack open crustacean exoskeletons or shellfish shells, their mouthparts can also provide an improvised weapon in dire circumstances. The bodies of Ishi Tib are bulky and muscular. Their thick limbs end in two-fingered hands and fin-like feet that allow them to swim unimpeded through the water. Though their thick skin is resistant to water evaporation, the Ishi Tib are forever tied to the seas of their homeworld. To prevent their bodies from drying out, Ishi Tib must regularly immerse themselves in a saline liquid similar to that of Tibrin's oceans.

The horns of male Iktotchi tend to grow larger than those of female Iktotchi, though this is by no means an exact indicator of any individual's sex or gender. Should an Iktotchi's horns become damaged, they grow back over time in most cases. Also notable are their hands, which are almost half again as large as those of most similarly sized species, with relatively thick fingers. Members of the species enjoy a ninety-year life expectancy, given ideal conditions. Iktotchi possess precognitive abilities that they can hone through training, although these are considerably reduced in effectiveness away from their homeworld, the desolate moon called Iktotch. Some Iktotchi have also been reported to possess telepathic capabilities, but whether these Iktotchi actually have a gift for reading minds or can simply extrapolate others' thoughts by perceiving the future remains unclear to xenobiologists. To the Iktotchi themselves, for whom time does not appear as linear as it does to most other species, the practical distinction between clairvoyance and telepathy is often blurry or irrelevant. Most humans do not seek to understand the biological principles that allow their eyes to transform light into coherent images; to most Iktotchi, precognition is as important yet mundane as sight. Iktotchi who hone their gift of foresight can grow extremely skilled as seers, however, and often hold positions of prestige in society.",

Their great height allowed the Anx to easily harvest the bounty of their homeworld's chiliox trees when they emerged from their subterranean habitat. Because the Anx evolved within the cave systems of their homeworld, their voices have a natural low-frequency echo that, while useful for communicating across vast distances underground, tends to make other species deeply uncomfortable. The Anx in turn are frequently discomfited by how other species have learned to read the color changes of the large crest atop their head as an indicator of their mood, a quirk of their communal lives in their native herd-based social structure.",

			"name": "Quermian",
			"description": "The Quermians are a tall, spindly species, with slender torsos surrounded by six limbs - including two pairs of arms - and extended necks nearly as lengthy as the trunks from which they rise. Their skin tends toward a pale, ashen hue, and is frequently wrinkled with slight folds. Their faces have only smooth skin where the nose is found on many other species, instead, olfactory organs on their hands perform the function of detecting scents. Like the Xexto, Quermians have two brains, one in their head and one in their chest. Unlike their cousins, who divide different functions between the two brains, Quermians each have two fully developed brains. In some Quermians, each of hte two brains even develops its own separate personality. In Quermians who are controlled by a unified mind, the secondary brain operates in tandem with the first, processing input with a level of detail and insight that can seem uncanny to many other species, in particular, the dual brains of the Quermians allow them to read otherwise undetectable signals in the body language of any species. Quermians sometimes exploit this understanding to communicate silently through minute shifts in posture, allowing them to act in concert without any words being exchanged. The level of insight and communication Quermians are known to display has given them a strange reputation among other species, who sometimes suspect them of possessing further gifts, or even an innate Force sensitivity.",

Although humanoid in form, Dowutins have as much in common with banthas and dewback as with any human or near-human species. Vestigial tusks, although ineffective as weapons, are a reminder of the Dowutins' ancestors, omnivorous herd beasts taht roamed the frigit plain of Dowut. These tusks helped the creatures to forage for roots, insects, and hibernating feeks. Dowutins are more sophisticated in their diets, and many put their great strength and stamina to use as hunters, rather than as foragers. Dowutins' fingers end in thick, tough spikes - the word \"claw\" hardly does them justice - made of the same bony material as their tusks. Although problematic for delicate manual tasks, these talons provide an effective means of self=defense and even augment the Dowutins' considerable strength, whether for prying apart bulkhead doors or dismantling a troublesome droid bare-handed.",

Coloration varies greatly even among closely related Mikkians, and more often than not, siblings or parents and children are completely different colors. Mikkians' features are typical of most humanoid species, with the notable exception of a lack of ears and the presence of motile head-tendrils. Even more distinctive than their skin tones is the seemingly endless variety in Mikkians' head-tendrils. No two sets are identical; they vary in both number and form, to the extend that many outsiders are surprised to learn any two Mikkians are of the same species. Head-tendrils range from fanlike crests and tape-like ribbons to cylindrical tentacles and membranous fins. Some taper from a broad base to a thin tip, while others are consistent, and they vary in length from a few centimeters up to nearly a half-meter. The number of tendrils on a Mikkian's head similarly ranges from only a handful to dozens.",

They are inseparable, as the species have coevolved for millions of years. Fungal tissues exist throughout the entire body of each Phydolon, forming membranes and threads laced through the flesh and organs, even the brain. These threads perform vital functions within the tissues of the Orucyte's symbiotic partner. The Agaran acts as the \"host\", providing the locomotion for the pair. Beyond that, both beings are in total unison. Phydolons are bipedal humanoids with long, gangly limbs, knobbed joints, and hands with an opposable thumb and three long fingers tipped with hard, almost bark-like nails. Their heads are broad and sloping, and their eyes are large, lidless orbs with a central pupil, white iris, and dark-colored sclera veined through with white fungal threads. The average Phydolon stands roughly two meters tall and weighs significantly less than a human of comparable height.",
