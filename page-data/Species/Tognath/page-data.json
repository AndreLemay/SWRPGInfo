They stand just under two meters on average. Evolutionarily ancient, with robust but undeveloped nervous systems, they often use cybernetic nehancements to augment their otherwise sub-par hearing and balance. Many wear special lenses to aid in vision as well. Such augmentations might appear painful, but their primitive nervous systems mean they are immune to such annoyances. Tognath share many genetic ties with the Kel Dors and Gands, but whether this genetic relationship is hte result of evolution or experimentation is unknown.","brawn":2,"agility":2,"intellect":2,"cunning":2,"willpower":3,"presence":1,"startXP":95,"wounds":9,"strain":9,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in Coordination and 1 rank in Perception thanks to Cybernetic implants and specialized lenses.
