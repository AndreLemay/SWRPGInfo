Most visibly, Sakiyans have enlarged bifurcated craniums, lack any hair, and have pointed ears. Their skin is highly reflective, like burnished metal, and varies in color from jet black and dark grey to varying shades of red, blue, and purple. Pale-skinned and albino Sakiyans exist as well. Nearly twice the size of the average human brain, the highly evolved brains of the Sakiyans are able to process impressive amounts of sensory information. As such, Sakiyans have extraordinary sense: they are able to see int othe infrared spectrium and possess truly exceptional hearing and smell. Some Sakiyan hunters are said to track their prey by smell alone.","brawn":2,"agility":2,"intellect":3,"cunning":2,"willpower":2,"presence":2,"startXP":80,"wounds":8,"strain":10,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in Perception or Vigilance, and 1 rank in Expert Tracker talent.","specialAbilities":""}}}}
