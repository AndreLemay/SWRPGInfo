Drall have short snouts and small, almond-shaped black eyes which are sensitive to bright light. Their limbs are relatively short, giving them a somewhat dwarfish appearance, with well-articulated four-fingered hands and back-bent legs ending in slender, clawed feet. Drall mature quickly relative to humans, and tend to live for about one hundred galactic standard years.","brawn":1,"agility":1,"intellect":4,"cunning":2,"willpower":2,"presence":2,"startXP":90,"wounds":8,"strain":12,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in Knowledge (Education).","specialAbilities":"Add 1 Boost to the dice pool when providing skilled assistance"}}}}
