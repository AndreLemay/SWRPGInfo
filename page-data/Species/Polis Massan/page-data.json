Though the majority of Polis Massans lack vocal chords, they are able to communicate with others using a simple form of telepathy.","brawn":1,"agility":2,"intellect":3,"cunning":2,"willpower":3,"presence":1,"startXP":100,"wounds":8,"strain":11,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in Medicine.","specialAbilities":"Most lack vocal chords, though players can spend 10 XP during character creation to have their character be among the rare \"speakers\" that do have vocal chords.
