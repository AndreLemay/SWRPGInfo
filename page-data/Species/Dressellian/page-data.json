Some refer to them as \"prune faces\", a derogatory term guaranteed to incense any Dressellian within earshot. Most Dresselian eyes can range from bright yellow to golden orange and provide slightly improved night vision. Dressellians are bright and agile, making them fierce warriors when cornered. Their blood is a bright teal, which is indicative of inefficient circulatory systems and a genetically recent marine heritage. As a result, Dressellians consume oxygen at almost double the rate of comparably sized humanoids.","brawn":2,"agility":2,"intellect":2,"cunning":2,"willpower":3,"presence":1,"startXP":110,"wounds":11,"strain":10,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in Survival.","specialAbilities":"Upgrade teh difficulty of any checks involving technology.
