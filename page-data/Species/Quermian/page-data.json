{"componentChunkName":"component---src-templates-species-tsx","path":"/Species/Quermian","result":{"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"species":{"name":"Quermian","description":"The Quermians are a tall, spindly species, with slender torsos surrounded by six limbs - including two pairs of arms - and extended necks nearly as lengthy as the trunks from which they rise. Their skin tends toward a pale, ashen hue, and is frequently wrinkled with slight folds. Their faces have only smooth skin where the nose is found on many other species, instead, olfactory organs on their hands perform the function of detecting scents. Like the Xexto, Quermians have two brains, one in their head and one in their chest. Unlike their cousins, who divide different functions between the two brains, Quermians each have two fully developed brains. In some Quermians, each of hte two brains even develops its own separate personality. In Quermians who are controlled by a unified mind, the secondary brain operates in tandem with the first, processing input with a level of detail and insight that can seem uncanny to many other species, in particular, the dual brains of the Quermians allow them to read otherwise undetectable signals in the body language of any species. Quermians sometimes exploit this understanding to communicate silently through minute shifts in posture, allowing them to act in concert without any words being exchanged. The level of insight and communication Quermians are known to display has given them a strange reputation among other species, who sometimes suspect them of possessing further gifts, or even an innate Force sensitivity.","brawn":1,"agility":2,"intellect":3,"cunning":2,"willpower":2,"presence":1,"startXP":85,"wounds":10,"strain":10,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in Perception.","specialAbilities":"Gain an additional free maneuver per turn (still limited to 2 maneuvers per turn)."}}}}
