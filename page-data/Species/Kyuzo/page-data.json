They are bipedal, with thin arms and legs that conceal their considerable strength. Their hands have four digits. Due to the uncommon makeup of their homeworld's atmosphere, Kyuzo frequently wear filter masks when in galactic standard habitable environment. Though going without these masks isn't fatal, doing so makes Kyuzo ill in a short time, interferes with their ability to concetrate, and slows them down considerably. Like many species, Kyuzo span a broad range in terms of height and build, with some members of the species towering over most humans and others considerably smaller in stature. Interestingly, there are two primary phenotypes within the Kyuzo population; some have compound eyes while others have eyes with pupils akin to those of humans. The exact genetic history behind this divergence is known to few non-Kyuzo scholars, but the two groups are genetically compatible, with offspring inheriting one trait or the other from a parent.","brawn":2,"agility":3,"intellect":2,"cunning":2,"willpower":2,"presence":1,"startXP":90,"wounds":11,"strain":11,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in Coordination.","specialAbilities":"Once per round as a maneuver, can suffer 3 strain to leap horizontally or vertically to any location within medium range."}}}}
