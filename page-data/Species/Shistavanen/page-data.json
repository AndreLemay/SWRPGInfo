They are completely covered by short, thick fur that is often brown or black. They have upgright, pointed ears on the upper sides of their heads, and have a fearsome visage when they bare their sharp teeth. Shistavanens have extremly sharp senses, especially vision, hearing, and smell. The Shistavanen gait alternates naturally between walking upright and on all fours, and they can bound through rough ground with impressive speed and stability. Shistavanens are naturally surefooted, giving them a further advantage when hunting or traversing terrain quickly. Their digits have large black claws, and they usually walk barefoot. Shistavanens range between a little over a meter to almost two meters tall.","brawn":2,"agility":3,"intellect":3,"cunning":2,"willpower":1,"presence":1,"startXP":80,"wounds":12,"strain":10,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in either Brawl or Survival.","specialAbilities":"When making an initiative check, can make a Survival check instead of Discipline or Cool."}}}}
