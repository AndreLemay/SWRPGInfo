A Droid Tech can keep droids functional and organized better than anyone else, whether this means meticulously performing upgrades and customizations on a trusted droid partner or keeping a team of pit droids working at maximum efficiency. Far from official factories and even from well-stocked garages where replacement parts can be found, a Droid Tech can be incredibly valuable.","careerSkills":["Computers","Cool","Mechanics","Leadership"],"talents":[{"name":"Machine Mender","description":"When making a Mechanics check to help a character heal wounds, the target heals 1 additional wound per rank of Machine Mender.","column":1,"row":1,"passive":true,"connections":[false,false,false,true]},{"name":"Hidden Storage","description":"Gain hidden storage in vehicles or equipment that holds items with total encumbrance equal to ranks in Hidden Storage.","column":2,"row":1,"passive":true,"connections":[false,false,false,true]},{"name":"Speaks Binary","description":"When directing NPC droids, may grant them 1 Boost per rank of Speaks Binary on checks.","column":3,"row":1,"passive":true,"connections":[false,false,false,true]},{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 Strain Threshold","column":4,"row":1,"passive":true,"connections":[false,false,false,true]},{"name":"Deft Maker","description":"Remove 1 Setback per rank of Deft Maker from checks to repair, modify, construct, or program droids.
