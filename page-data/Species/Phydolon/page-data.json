They are inseparable, as the species have coevolved for millions of years. Fungal tissues exist throughout the entire body of each Phydolon, forming membranes and threads laced through the flesh and organs, even the brain. These threads perform vital functions within the tissues of the Orucyte's symbiotic partner. The Agaran acts as the \"host\", providing the locomotion for the pair. Beyond that, both beings are in total unison. Phydolons are bipedal humanoids with long, gangly limbs, knobbed joints, and hands with an opposable thumb and three long fingers tipped with hard, almost bark-like nails. Their heads are broad and sloping, and their eyes are large, lidless orbs with a central pupil, white iris, and dark-colored sclera veined through with white fungal threads. The average Phydolon stands roughly two meters tall and weighs significantly less than a human of comparable height.","brawn":2,"agility":2,"intellect":2,"cunning":2,"willpower":3,"presence":1,"startXP":100,"wounds":10,"strain":10,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in Cool or Discipline.","specialAbilities":"When recovering wounds naturally, heal 1 extra wound per full night's rest. May attempt to recover naturally from one Critical Injury after a full night's rest, instead of after a full week. If no other Phydolons are present, when recovering strain at the end of an encounter, recover 1 less strain (to a minimum of 1)."}}}}
