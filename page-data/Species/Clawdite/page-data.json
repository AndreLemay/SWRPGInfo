Clawdites are a humanoid species with reptilian traits. In their default forms, their skin has a yellow to dark green. The pupils of their large eyes are slitted, with irises that range in color from yellow to deep blue. However, many galactic citizens who interact with Clawdites never actually see this form, or even know that they are dealing with a Clawdite. Some Clawdites create a single preferred guise that they use for their public dealings, never showing their true form. This has various advantages, from thowing potential enemies off guard when they reveal themselves to keeping suspicion that they might be an infiltrator to a minimum. After all, when people know there is a Clawdite around, they tend to be more cautious. On the other hand, some Clawdites use this to their advantage by openly displaying their true forms, to remind everyone of their unique ability - especially when that ability is an asset to the job at hand. Those Clawdites who do not rely upon their shapeshifting for professional reasons tend to remain in their default state aroudn others to ehlp reassure them that they are acting in good faith. These practices vary by individual and the expectations of the company that they currently keep.","brawn":2,"agility":2,"intellect":2,"cunning":3,"willpower":1,"presence":2,"startXP":95,"wounds":9,"strain":9,"startSkills":"Begin wiht 1 rank in Resilience","specialAbilities":"As an action, may suffer 3 strain and make an Average Resilience check; on success, change appearance to match that of a silhouette 1 character that has been observed before.
