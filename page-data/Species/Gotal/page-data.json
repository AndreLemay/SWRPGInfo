A coarse, dense layer of fur covers these rugged bipeds in shades ranging from sandy brown to smoky gray. Tiny vestigial nostrils, a pair of beady red eyes, and a wide grimace adorn their gristly, elongated faces. From their heavily knobbed brow sprouts a pair of conical bovid horns packed with millions of nerve clusters sensistive to electromagnetic fields, radio waves, and numerous other forms of energy. Gotals use their energy detecting horns as their primary sensory organs, since the peculiar conditions of their moon make it difficult to function by sight alone.","brawn":2,"agility":2,"intellect":2,"cunning":3,"willpower":2,"presence":1,"startXP":100,"wounds":9,"strain":8,"startSkills":"Begin with 1 rank in Perception.","specialAbilities":"Once per encounter as a maneuver, may sense the presence and current emotional states of all living things within short range."}}}}
