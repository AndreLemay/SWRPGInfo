There is good reason to be scared, few other species in the galaxy match either the streight of a Wookiee or the depths of a Wookiee's temper. Their limbs are long, with retractable claws on their fingers and toes for the arboreal environment of their homeworld. These claws are only used for climbing, never for combat, as such an act is seen as dishonorable in Wookiee culture. Their fur grows in a variety of colors, becoming darker in middle age and then graying or whitening in later years (Wookiees can live for centuries).","brawn":3,"agility":2,"intellect":2,"cunning":2,"willpower":1,"presence":2,"startXP":90,"wounds":14,"strain":8,"startSkills":"Begin game with 1 rank in Brawl.","specialAbilities":"When any wounds have been suffered, deal +1 damage with Brawl and Melee attacks.
