Stubby protruding snouts dominate their craggy faces, and their spindly arms and legs end with three fingers and three toes, respectively. One of their most interesting physical features has to do with their brains; they are completely immune to any manipulations via the Force.","brawn":1,"agility":1,"intellect":2,"cunning":2,"willpower":3,"presence":3,"startXP":90,"wounds":9,"strain":12,"startSkills":"None","specialAbilities":"Smaller than average and count as silhouette 0.
